-   Semi-colon terminator is required

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->

-   Use `.help` for a complete list

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="topic" title="Specifying Columns" %}

    -   Duplicates allowed
-   Line breaks <strike>allowed</strike> encouraged for readability

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="topic" title="Sorting" %}

{% include double.md stem="sort" suffix="sql out" %}

-   `order by` must follow `from` (which must follow `select`)
-   `asc` is ascending, `desc` is descending
    -   Default is ascending, but please specify

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="exercise" %}

Write a SQL query to select the sex and body mass columns from the `little_penguins` in that order,

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="topic" title="Limiting Output" %}

-   Full dataset has 344 rows

{% include double.md stem="limit" suffix="sql out" %}

-   Comments start with `--` and run to the end of the line
-   <code>limit <em>N</em></code> specifies maximum number of rows returned by query

{% include section_break.md class="topic" title="Paging Output" %}

{% include double.md stem="page" suffix="sql out" %}

-   <code>offset <em>N</em></code> must follow `limit`
-   Specifies number of rows to skip from the start of the selection
-   So this query skips the first 3 and shows the next 10

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="topic" title="Removing Duplicates" %}

{% include double.md stem="distinct" suffix="sql out" %}

-   `distinct` keyword must appear right after `select`
    -   SQL was supposed to read like English
-   Shows distinct combinations
-   Blanks in `sex` column show missing data
    -   We'll talk about this in a bit

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="exercise" %}

Write a SQL query to select the islands and species
from rows 50 to 60 inclusive of the `penguins` table.

{% include double.md stem="filter" suffix="sql out" %}

-   <code>where <em>condition</em></code> <a href="#g:filter">filters</a> the rows produced by selection
-   Condition is evaluated independently for each row
-   Only rows that pass the test appear in results
-   Use single quotes for `'text data'` and double quotes for `"weird column names"`
    -   SQLite will accept double-quoted text data but [SQLFluff][sqlfluff] will complain

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="exercise" %}

{% include exercise.md %}
Write a query to select the body masses from `penguins` that are less than 3000.0 grams.

{% include exercise.md %}
Write another query to select the species and sex of penguins that weight less than 3000.0 grams.
This shows that the columns displayed and those used in filtering are independent of each other.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="topic" title="Filtering with More Complex Conditions" %}

{% include double.md stem="filter_and" suffix="sql out" %}

-   `and`: both sub-conditions must be true

    -   We'll talk about this in a bit

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="exercise" %}

{% include exercise.md %}
Use the `not` operator to select penguins that are *not* Gentoos.

{% include exercise.md %}
SQL's `or` is an <a href="#g:inclusive_or">inclusive or</a>:
it succeeds if either *or both* conditions are true.
SQL does not provide a specific operator for <a href="#g:exclusive_or">exclusive or</a>,
which is true if either *but not both* conditions are true,
but the same effect can be achieved using `and`, `or`, and `not`.
Write a query to select penguins that are female *or* on Torgersen Island *but not both*.

{% include section_break.md class="exercise" %}

{% include exercise.md %}
Write a single query that calculates and returns:

1.  A column called `what_where` that has the species and island of each penguin
    separated by a single space.
2.  A column called `bill_ratio` that has the ratio of bill length to bill depth.

You can use the `||` operator to concatenate text to solve part 1,

-   SQL uses a special value <a href="#g:null"><code>null</code></a> to representing missing data
    -   Not 0 or empty string, but "I don't know"
-   Flipper length and body weight not known for one of the first five penguins
-   "I don't know" divided by 10 or 1000 is "I don't know"

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="exercise" %}

{% include exercise.md %}
Use SQLite's `.nullvalue` command

When will displaying null as `null` be easier to understand?
When might it be misleading?

What is the average body mass of penguins that weight more than 3000.0 grams?

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="topic" title="Counting" %}

{% include double.md stem="count_behavior" suffix="sql out" %}

-   Put rows in <a href="#g:group">groups</a> based on distinct combinations of values in columns specified with `group by`
-   Then perform aggregation separately for each group
-   But which is which?

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="topic" title="Behavior of Unaggregated Columns" %}

{% include double.md stem="unaggregated_columns" suffix="sql out" %}

-   All rows in each group have the same value for `sex`, so no need to aggregate

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% include section_break.md class="topic" title="Arbitrary Choice in Aggregation" %}

{% include double.md stem="arbitrary_in_aggregation" suffix="sql out" %}

-   If we don't specify how to aggregate a column,
    SQLite chooses *any arbitrary value* from the group
    -   All penguins in each group have the same sex because we grouped by that, so we get the right answer
    -   The body mass values are in the data but unpredictable
    -   A common mistake
-   Other database managers don't do this
    -   E.g., PostgreSQL complains that column must be used in an aggregation function

Saving and restoring data as text:

Saving and restoring data in binary format:

1.  Re-create the `notes` table in an in-memory database once again
    and use SQLite's `.backup` command to save it to a file called `notes.db`.

-   View is re-run each time it's used
-   Like a CTE, but:
    -   Can be shared between queries
    -   Views came first
-   Some databases offer <a href="#g:materialized_view">materialized views</a>
    -   Update-on-demand temporary tables

Create a view in the lab log database called `busy` with two columns:
`machine_id` and `total_log_length`.
The first column records the numeric ID of each machine;
the second shows the total number of log entries for that machine.

Rewrite the definition of the `penguins` table to add the following constraints:

1.  `body_mass_g` must be null or non-negative.

Using the penguins database:

1.  create a table called `species` with columns `name` and `count`; and

2.  define a trigger that increments the count associated with each species
    each time a new penguin is added to the `penguins` table.

Does your solution behave correctly when several penguins are added
by a single `insert` statement?
